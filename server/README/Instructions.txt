Tech used: mongodb/mongoose + nodejs/expressjs

1. Run "npm install"

2. Ensure localhost port 5000 is useable, otherwise configure port in index.js

3. Run "nodemon start"

4. Create a post (first requirement of the exercise: any user can start a new post/discussion)

    in postman:

        [POST] url: http://localhost:5000/posts

        send the following JSON:
        {
            "username": "Professor A",
            "content": "How is everyone doing?"
        }

        this will return the posted post object with an _id parameter
        use this _id below

5. Create a comment (second requirement of the exercise: any user can respond to a post/discussion or comment)

    in postman:

        [POST] url: http://localhost:5000/${_idOfPostCreatedAbove}/comments

        send the following JSON:
        {
            "username": "Professor A",
            "comment": "How is everyone doing?"
        }

        again this will return the posted comment object with an _id parameter
        use this _id below

6. Create a reply to a comment - comment on comment. (second requirement of the exercise: any user can respond to a post/discussion or comment)

    in postman:

        [POST] url: http://localhost:5000/${_idOfCommentCreatedAbove}/comments/new

        send the following JSON:
        {
            "username": "Professor A",
            "comment": "How is everyone doing?"
        }

7. Ensure localhost connection is killed (stop nodemon) 

8. Run "npm test" from root folder

    All 9 unit tests should pass.

9. You can now create posts or comments as you wish

    note: 
        to create a post, you need to populate the "username" AND "content" attributes
        to create a comment or a reply (comment on comment), you need to populate the "username" AND "comment" attributes
        put/patch/delete are not included since they were not in the scope of the exercise.
        please let me know if they are required.

10. Retrieve all comments available in the database in a flat tree (third requirement)

    e.g.
        Use http://localhost:5000/posts 
            or
        Use http://localhost:5000/posts/${postId} 
            or
        any other GET route

    [Important]: once data is fetched, they will populate the output folder (server/output/)
        as either allDiscussions.json, post.json, comments.json or commentsOfcomment.json
        depending on which path used. IF CONTENT OF THE FILE IS NOT BEAUTIFIED, PLEASE
        SAVE FILE (i.e. cmd + s) TO VIEW THE FLAT TREE.
